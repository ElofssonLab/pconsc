***************************************************
 PconsC : Combination of direct information methods 
         and alignments improves contact prediction
***************************************************

PconsC requires:
	* Python interpreter (tested from Python 2.6 onwards)
	* scikit-learn module (http://scikit-learn.org/)
	* jackhmmer (part of HMMER package http://hmmer.janelia.org/software)
	* HHblits (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhblits)
	* PSICOV (http://bioinfadmin.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/PSICOV/)
	* sequence databases for jackhmmer (BLAST-formatted protein database, 
	  e.g. nr90, uniref90) and HHblits (bundled with software, nr20)

After installing the necessary software, set paths in localpaths.py

Usage:

PconsC to work requires 12 input files: 
	6x PSICOV predictions for jackhmmer and HHblits alignments at 3 e-values
	6x DCA predictions for jackhmmer and HHblits alignments at 3 e-values

If you have these files, use ./predict.py to predict contacts

PconsC is capable of generating these file on its own, provided the proper paths
are set. Use ./predictAll.py

Output format:
aa1 	aa2 	contact_propensity

Example:
1	5	0.003
1	6	0.007
1	7	0.200
[...]
27	43	0.952

The higher the propensity, the more likely are two residues to be in contact
